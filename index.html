    <h2>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</h2>
  <p>
    HTML serves as the backbone of every web page, acting as a markup language that defines the structure and content of a webpage. Think of it as the foundation upon which everything else is built. HTML uses tags to organize content elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. These tags instruct the browser on how to display the page's content, making it readable and interactive for users. Without HTML, the web would be nothing more than a jumbled mess of text and media.

    <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h2>
  <p>
    While HTML takes care of the structure, CSS is responsible for the presentation and styling of a webpage. It allows web developers to customize the appearance of HTML elements by specifying properties such as colors, fonts, layout, and positioning. CSS enables a website to look visually appealing, ensuring a consistent and uniform design across all pages. The separation of HTML and CSS also improves maintainability, making it easier to update the website's look without altering its content.

    <h2>JavaScript (JS):</h2>
  <p>
    If HTML and CSS are the bones and skin of a website, JavaScript is undoubtedly the brains behind the operation. This dynamic scripting language adds interactivity and functionality to web pages, making them more engaging and responsive. With JavaScript, developers can create pop-up dialogues, sliders, interactive forms, and much more. Additionally, JS allows interaction with web APIs, enabling real-time data updates and seamless integration with other services.
